          <h2>Origins</h2>
          <p>
            Hummus is a Middle Eastern dip, spread, or savory dish made from
            cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and
            garlic. The standard garnish in the Middle East includes olive oil,
            a few whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika.

          <li>Make the Confit Garlic Oil</li>
          <li>
            Set about 100 grams of the cooked chick- peas aside in a small bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the remaining chickpeas, tahini paste, 8 of the confit garlic
            cloves, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and the lemon juice to the bowl of a food
            processor and blitz until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. With the machine
            running, slowly drizzle in the ice water
          </li>
          <li>
            until completely smooth and aerated. You may have to add slightly
            more water to reach the desired texture. Taste and adjust for
            seasoning if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the parsley, 2 tablespoons of Confit Garlic Oil, and a pinch of
            salt to the bowl with the reserved chickpeas, and stir to combine.
            Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the hummus to a shallow platter and smooth it out with the
            back of a spoon, creating a slight well in the center. (It’s okay if
            the hummus is a little runny; hummus will set as it cools.) Spread
            the Tahini Sauce into the well, then spoon the herbed chickpea
            mixture over the top of the tahini. Top the dish with the remaining
            confit garlic cloves along with some of the aromatics in the jar
            (thyme and chili). Finish with a drizzle of Confit Garlic Oil.

            The key to lip-smack- ing hummus? Cooking your own chickpeas. The
            first ingredient? Baking soda. Use a bit to soak dried chickpeas a
            day in advance, which helps break down the legume's skin. This
            allows them to absorb more mois- ture, ultimately making for a
            softer, smoother hummus. (If you really want to skip this step,
            there are a few high-quality canned chickpea brands. Look for ones
            from Spain or Portugal.) Cook times can vary greatly—as little as 30
            minutes or up to 1 hour—depending on a number of factors, including
            age and the freshness of the pea. For hummus, it's important to boil
            the chickpeas until they can easily be squished be- tween your
            fingers, ensuring a smooth blend. And only add salt in the last 15
            minutes of cooking; if you season chickpeas too early, they wont
            ever soften.

              soda. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat
              to medium, cover with a lid, and cook for at least 30 minutes and
              up to 60 minutes, skimming the top as necessary, until soft enough
              to crush between two fingers. Remove the lid, add the salt, and
              continue to cook for 15 minutes to season the chickpeas. Drain and
              set aside until ready to use.

          <p>
            Tahini is something that runs in the veins of the people in the
            Middle East. This paste made from ground toasted sesame seeds is
            ubiquitous in Middle Eastern cooking, with some families using it at
            every meal. Tahini is made from sesame seeds that are toasted, and
            ground to produce an oily paste.

          <p>
            This is the ideal con- diment to have on hand anytime you want to
            add a warm, mellow garlic flavor to a dish. Cooking the cloves
            slowly leaves them slightly sweet—perfect as a garnish or for
            mashing into a confit. You also get a lovely garlic-infused oil that
            can be drizzled over salads or used for dipping bread. You can play
            with this recipe by adding other aromatics to the oil (sage leaves,
            or orange or lemon skin). Feel free to double or triple the recipe,
            too: Cook the garlic in an ovenproof pan at 120°C/250°F with enough
            oil to submerge the cloves. Seal the pan tightly with foil, and cook
            until the cloves are soft and very lightly colored. Store the cloves
            in their oil in an airtight jar at room temperature for several
            weeks.

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>12 garlic cloves, peeled</li>

            <li>6 thyme sprigs</li>

            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>

            <li>200 ml olive oil</li>

          <h3>Method</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Combine all ingredients in a small sauce- pan over medium-low
              heat. Cover and cook until the garlic is soft and just begin- ning
              to color, about 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leave the lid on, remove from the heat, and set aside for 10
              minutes; the garlic will continue to cook in the heat of the oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strain the oil into a clean glass jar and spoon in the garlic,
              thyme, and chili. Once cool, transfer everything to an airtight,
              sterilized jar and store at room tempera- ture for several weeks.

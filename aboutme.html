    </ul>

    <h3>What's your favourite ingredient to cook with?</h3>
    <p>
      Defintely cumin and koriander, they come often in my recipes giving them a
      special punch of flavour.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of recipes can I find here?</h3>
    <p>
      Honestly, a mix of everything, from mexican to korean to middle eastern
      inspired. Deliciously indulgent, full of flavour and vegetables.
    </p>

    <h3>When and why did you stop eating meat?</h3>
    <p>
      I started transitioning to vegetarianism back in 2019, having an
      autoinmune disease weakining my body I decided to take action and
      radically change my diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always cared for the planet, and knew stopping eating meat would
      lower my carbon footprint, so I had another good reason to quit meat.
      After watching some documentaries about factory farming it became clear
      that I could no longer ignore how damaging the meat and dairy industry
      were, so I started my food blog called
      <a href="https://instagram.com/maisonverde"> @maisonverde</a> and
      spreading tips and recipes about how to succesfully transition into a
      whole foods plant based diet.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies (outside of cooking)</h3>
    <p>
      I recently started learning how to program, and coding ever since has
      become something I greatly enjoy doing. I also like to read, learn about
      healing herbs, listen to music (love electronic music), paint with
      watercolor and photography.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you have a cookbook?</h3>
    <p>Not yet but working on it!</p>

    <h3>What's your cooking philosophy?</h3>
    <p>
      You deserve to eat nourishing delicious and seasonal food without having
      to compromise anything on flavour, being vegetarian does not mean eating
      only lettuce salads.
